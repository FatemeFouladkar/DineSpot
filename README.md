<br><br>

A small project using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/). 

In DineSpot, users can view all the dining spots in Mashhad along with their details. Also the owners of dining spots can request adding their own place via a Django form. 
* For more info on integrating Django with Folium, check out [this article](https://medium.com/@FatemeFouladkar/how-i-integrated-folium-with-django-d04dc5b25048)

## WorkFlow
On the main page, you'll be able to see a map of Mashhad and all the dining spots, specified with folium markers:

<img width="80%" src="./README_images/main_page.png"/>

By clicking on each marker, you'll be able to see all the available data about the dining spot:

<img width="80%" src="./README_images/dining_spot_detail.gif" />

In order to request for new dining spots, click on 'Add Your Dining Spot' on the menu. Fill the form in the new page to send out your request:

<img width="80%" src="./README_images/request_dining_spot.png" />

When the request is submitted, an email will be sent to the superuser, so that he can confirm the new dining spot. 
As the superuser, you can login to the admin panel by heading to `localhost:8000/admin`. You'll be able so view all the dining spots like so:

<img width="80%" src="./README_images/DiningSpot_admin_panel.png" />

You can confirm the new record using admin actions, or just heading to the details page of the new dining spot. 

In order to show the right location of the new places on the map, you need to update the map in the admin panel:

<img width="80%" src="./README_images/Editing_location.png" />

As the new dining spot is confirmed, a new email will be sent to the dining owner to inform them.
